# Turing-compiler
an optimizing compiler to a binary turing machine

# notes for devs
the make test system deletes the compiled files. since everything compiles under a second its not an issue. 
if this is not desirble test.py would work by itself. 

# TODO 
1. fix bug in the interpeter
2. unify the cli tools

## parser
add better error handeling with a dedicated struct.
